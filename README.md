# SeeBoxPCB

The PCB files for assembling the SeeBox device's board. The files are created using KiCad. Print the board using a PCB milling machine. You can use the schematic file and modify the final PCB board based on the size of your machine’s drill bits (the current sizes are bigger than usual due to our lower quality machine), but it fits the proposed packaging design.
You can find out more about the device on our online documentation: https://dtech.moraeslab.com/projects/team-ron/
